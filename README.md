# golarion-map
A full screen Map of Golarion.

This is the same map used on https://pathfinderwiki.com/ (using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)) but full screen for ease of use.

Props to [John Mechalas](https://www.dungeonetics.com/golarion-geography/index.html) and his amazing map data <3

I've built a [custom version](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/glordu/ckyynllyj002l15p1f3xs2ez9.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2xvcmR1IiwiYSI6ImNreXltYWZ6dzB0bDQyd3FsODl4N2dna2UifQ.8zCcIZosaJx3v0q5_BlBnA&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#5.81/49.884/-27.444) of the map using the same data, but it doesn't look as nice as this one.
